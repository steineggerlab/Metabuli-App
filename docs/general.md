# Metabuli App 

This is the desktop application for Metabuli, a metagenomic classifier that jointly analyzes both DNA and amino acid sequences. Built with Vue.js and Electron, it provides an easy interface for running metagenomic classification jobs and visualizing the results.

## NOTE
The `NCBI` and `Assemblies` buttons in the Sankey subtree view do not work when searching against a GTDB-based database. 
We will make a button for GTDB soon.

## Platforms Supported
- macOS (`.dmg`)
- Windows (`.exe`)
- Linux (`.AppImage`)

## Functionality
- **Download** pre-built **databases**
- **Create or update databases**
- Raw-read **quality control (QC)**
- Run **taxonomic classification**
- **Upload and browse** classification results
- **Extract reads** classified under a specific taxon
- Explore results with interactive **Sankey** and **Krona** plots.

## Changelog

### v1.1.0
- **Added** `Raw-read Quality Control (QC)` **functionality** via [fastp](https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp)/[fastplong](https://github.com/OpenGene/fastplong).
- Supports **uploading multiple samples at once** for sequential classification or raw-read pre-processing.
- **User manuals** have been added to each page for easier reference and guidance on how to use each feature.
- **Sankey plot improvements:** Now powered by the latest version of [TaxoView](https://github.com/steineggerlab/taxoview), which supports extensive customization and improved interactivity:
  - New visual settings: adjust node label width, padding, font size, and x-axis rank label size.
  - Users can select which taxonomic ranks to display.
  - Node colors are now grouped by `domain`, with gradient shading to clarify taxonomic hierarchy.
  - Users can choose from a selection of color schemes in the customization settings.

### v1.0.1
- Introduced the `Custom Database` page, enabling users to:
    - Create new databases.
    - Add new sequences to existing databases.
- Enhanced `Sankey visualization`:
    - Implemented Sankey plot verification for ensuring accuracy of visualized results.
    - Resolved a bug in lineage extraction from raw data that previously caused inaccuracies in lineage representation on the Sankey plot.

### v1.0.0
- Initial release of Metabuli App.
